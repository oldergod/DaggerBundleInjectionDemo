Demo application of bundle injection in Android using Dagger.

See the blog post: TODO

This codebase uses the latest Dagger Android's API. If you prefer to check the code without any `dagger.android` APIs, you can check the [`dagger` branch](https://github.com/oldergod/DaggerBundleInjectionDemo/tree/dagger) which contains none of it.
